\abstract{

\noindent\textbf{Introduction: } Cherenkov radiation occurs when a charged particle travels through a dielectric medium at a speed greater than that of light \cite{cerenkovVisibleRadiationProduced1937}.
This phenomenon generates polarized light, which can be utilized to detect and quantify radiation dose distributions in medical applications such as radiotherapy \cite{ashrafDosimetryFLASHRadiotherapy2020}.
By using Cherenkov light emitted from the irradiated medium, this promising method allows real-time assessment of dose distribution \cite{jarvisCherenkovVideoImaging2014}.
Building upon previous research \cite{cloutierAccurateDoseMeasurements2022, cloutierDirectInwaterRadiation2022},
this study aims to characterize a novel, electro-optic polarizer system for in-water quantitative Cherenkov measurements.

\vspace{7.5pt}
\noindent\textbf{Methods: } Cherenkov emission is captured using a camera equipped with a charge-coupled device image sensor during the irradiation of a water tank with dimensions of
$15\times 15\times\SI{20}{cm^3}$ by photon and electron beams of varying energies, namely $\SI{6}{MV}$, $\SI{18}{MV}$, $\SI{6}{MeV}$, and $\SI{18}{MeV}$.
Analysis of Cherenkov radiation polarization is performed using a rotating linear polarizer alongside an innovative polarization modulator developed by PATQER Photonique.
This approach effectively extracts the polarized component of the signal, the average polarization angle, and the non-polarized portion of the signal without requiring any mechanical movements.
Reference data is obtained from radiochromic films and a treatment planning system.

\noindent\textbf{Results: } The measurements yield the normalized dose profile relative to the maximum irradiation dose and the depth dose profiles of the ionizing beam.
For multiple 16-bit pictures, the mean gray value in the region of interest inside the emission beam (shown in the figure \ref{fig:ROI}) was found to be $2.67\times 10^4$ counts, with a standard deviation of $8.40 \times 10^1$ counts.
These findings confirm the high reliability and reproducibility of this approach, validating the feasibility and relevance for accurate real-time assessment of dose distribution in radiotherapy.

\vspace{7.5pt}
\noindent\textbf{Conclusion: } Further studies could explore the application of this dosimetric method in clinical scenarios, including evaluating the FLASH effect \cite{ashrafDosimetryFLASHRadiotherapy2020}.
Moreover, a hybrid approach, combining the advantages of optical dosimetry with other dose measurement modalities, could be developed for comprehensive and precise dose distribution assessment in radiotherapy.}
